# Fallen Angels (Python)

The goal of this project was to use Python to replicate a project which was done in R before.

The new Python project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elky96/s-p-500-fallen-angel-analysis).

The previous R project can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/swerner1896/1087098).
